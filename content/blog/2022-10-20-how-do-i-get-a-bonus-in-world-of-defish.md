  Today, full disclosure about set bonus!


  The bonus will slightly increase all the rates (WOD, XP and Fish multipliers) of the item, if it is collected with other items of equipment of the same collection.

The bonus works on this principle: the more items from one collection are used in fishing session, the bigger your total bonus.

There are 34 complete sets, which consist of 5 items of basic equipment. There are also incomplete sets of 2–4 items. They will also give a bonus, but less.

### Let us give you an example:

**DISCLAIMER! ALL SUBSEQUENT NUMBERS ARE EXAMPLES ONLY, NOT OUTCOME INDICATORS**

Let’s imagine that you have 3 out of 5 items from the Shao-pan collection. Each item of equipment gives a +2% bonus to all rates of the item. Since you have 3 items, the total bonus is +6%.

This feature will be available for testing after off-chain release.
