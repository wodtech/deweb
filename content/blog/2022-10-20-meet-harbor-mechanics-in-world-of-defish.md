## **What’s this game mechanics about?**

With the Harbor you can move your catch from off-chain to blockchain. Namely: fish, materials and WOD. The Harbor works in the same way as the Defish Portal, but It’s intended for other items.

## **Why didn’t we combine the Harbor with the Defish Portal?**

This is due to technical costs. You will need to conduct separate transactions for different types of items: for materials, fish and WOD. In the future, we will combine this into one transaction.

## **Pay attention!**

To use fish as bait you need: move it to the blockchain, return to the off-chain again and then start fishing with a bait.
