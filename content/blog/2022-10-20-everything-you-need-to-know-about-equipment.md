# Marketplace



This is the first place each fisherman gets before his journey. After visiting the marketplace once it does not let you go. It makes you want to go here over and over. Sell your catch, buy new equipment, stock up on consumables. All transactions on the marketplace are paid in $WOD. Marketplace is a place where fishermen from all over the world meet to trade their catches.

# What can be sold / bought on the marketplace?

You can sell everything. Yes, every item in our game you can sell or buy on the marketplace:

* Equipment
* NFT fish
* Crafting materials
* Defishboxes
* Zones

All this can be sold or bought by players from other players.

But not everything can be bought from our game vendors. For example, from our vendors it is possible to buy items only with common, uncommon and rare rarity. All others are possible to get via crafting or DeFishboxes.

## Auction

You also can launch an auction on every item instead of simply set the price

# Who can trade on the marketplace?

Any user of the World of Defish, regardless of their level.

## Dashboard

Track your earnings and spending using a convenient dashboard and personal account. You can set notifications for the receipt of an item on the marketplace, or a price alert.



Well, it’s impossible to just visit the market place and not buy yourself a couple of rods and buy a brand-new boat for change.

# Equipment

There are 5 main inventory slots in the game, 3 auxiliary and 2 special slots.

​

Each item has its own level and attributes. The more you use an item, the more experience it gets. The experience gained can be spent on improving any equipment.



Main slots are required, so you can’t start fishing without filling all main slots which are basically parts of the fishing rod. Based on what is used in these slots, the main "character" of the fishing rod is formed.

Consumables slots are optional. You can start fishing even without them. Consumable items give you additional multipliers which can make your fishing rod better, but only for 1 session period, and after that will be burned.

Special slots are also optional. They give special characteristics to your rod or session. For example, in some zones you can’t fish without a boat and the net will increase the amount of fish which you can catch from the zone. Also, after use, these items are not burned, but remain with you, like the main items.

# How can I get the equipment?

You can get equipment by buying it on the marketplace, exchanging it directly with other players. Players can also get equipment for participating in the activities of the World of Defish and crafting.

Some items are focused only on a certain task, for example items that are focused on catching NFT fish will have a penalty in catching WOD, and vice versa.

## Multipliers

 

After we figured out the types of equipment, let's move on to analyzing the characteristics:

Each main item gives you a multiplier to all stats:

 

* WOD production E
* XP production
* Catch chance for each type of fish rarity
* Durability

 

BUT not every item gives the same multiplier to all stats. Some items can provide a high multiplier on one or two stats, but give nothing on the other. And vice versa, some items can be without any high multipliers, but they distribute their effectiveness across all characteristics. Or your Item can be not too profitable, but with very good durability and make you able to fish for a long time and catch more NFT fish.

And this is only 1 item! Your set-up consists of a minimum of 5 items.

## Rarity

Now let’s take a loot at rarity of items. In general, the rarer an item, the better its stats. Often the rarest items are sharpened for a strong improvement in one of the characteristics. There are 6 rarities: common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary and artifact

 

Every self-respecting Captain must master the art of crafting as an alternative way to obtain equipment. 

 

 

# Crafting

Crafting is an important part of the gameplay, which allows you to get new equipment, which you create with the help of caught materials in the workbench. 

# How it works?

At the end of the fishing session, parts and materials drop into your inventory. You can see the amount of your crafting materials in your inventory or fishing bag. By going to the special crafting tab, you can see the required amount of materials required to create an item, if you have enough materials, just select the item and click create, after the transaction is completed, the item will be in your inventory.
