description: We’re excited to announce that World of Defish — a decentralized
  NFT gaming universe — has integrated Chainlink Verifiable Random Function
  (VRF) on BNB Chain mainnet.

By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, we now have access to a tamper-proof source of on-chain randomness crucial for randomizing fishing drops and reward boxes in the Defish metaverse.

Ultimately, this creates more exciting and fair gaming experiences as players have strong assurances that ***random drops from fishing*** and ***rewards from*** ***Defish boxes*** are provably fair.

World of Defish has gathered thousands of admirers due to its unique gameplay mechanics. As a [play-to-earn](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-play-to-earn/) fishing game, World of Defish allows players to enter its ecosystem in a variety of ways to begin playing and earning. For example, players can stake NFTs or buy NFT zones to earn yield. Users can also utilize the crafting feature or get Defish boxes. Regardless of how players want to spend their resources, Chainlink VRF helps make the Defish ecosystem more convenient, reliable, and exciting.

In order to randomize fishing and Defish box rewards, we needed access to a secure random number generator (RNG) that any user could independently audit. However, RNG solutions for [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) require several security considerations to prevent manipulation and ensure system integrity. For instance, RNG solutions derived from blockchain data like block hashes can be exploited by miners/validators, while off-chain RNG solutions derived from off-chain APIs are opaque and don’t provide users with definitive proof about the integrity of the process.

After reviewing various solutions, we selected Chainlink VRF because it’s based on cutting-edge academic research, supported by a time-tested [oracle network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles), and secured through the generation and on-chain verification of cryptographic proofs that prove the integrity of each random number supplied to smart contracts.

Chainlink VRF works by combining block data that is still unknown when the request is made with the oracle node’s pre-committed private key to generate both a random number and a cryptographic proof. The World of Defish smart contract only accepts the random number input if it has a valid cryptographic proof, and the cryptographic proof can only be generated if the VRF process is tamper-proof. This provides our users with automated and verifiable assurances directly on-chain that World of Defish is provably fair and was not tampered with by the oracle, outside entities, or the World of Defish team.

In fact, World of Defish players can independently verify random numbers generated by Chainlink VRF on our **Public Beta today.**

“World of Defish aims to be Web3’s most prominent fishing-based GameFi project. Reaching that goal requires only the best infrastructure to further fair and exciting gameplay. As the industry standard solution for verifiable randomness, Chainlink VRF helps us achieve this goal and gives players higher assurances of an equal playing field.” — the World of Defish team.

**ABOUT CHAINLINK**

Chainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink oracle networks provide smart contracts with a way to reliably connect to any external API and leverage secure off-chain computations for enabling feature-rich applications. Chainlink currently secures tens of billions of dollars across DeFi, insurance, gaming, and other major industries, and offers global enterprises and leading data providers a universal gateway to all blockchains.
